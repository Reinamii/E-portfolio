            Second quarter ICT was so fun! Even though I probably failed all the tests,
            all the hands-on and lessons were easy to understand and to execute. I think
            this quarter has really deepened my love for coding. <br> <br>

            Thank you Ms. Uminga for being such a great teacher in a way that
            I understood all lessons well and got to code properly again, and for 
            always being kind and giving considerations. I can't wait for 3rd quarter! <br> <br>
